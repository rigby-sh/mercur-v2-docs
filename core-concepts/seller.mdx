# Seller

In Mercur, the `Seller` is the entity that represents member group in the marketplace.
You can think of a seller as a group of members that share the same products, orders etc.
By default, a seller is linked to Medusa's default entities such as:

- `Product`
- `Order`
- `Stock Location`
- `Service Zone`
- `Shipping Option`
- `Fulfillment Set`
